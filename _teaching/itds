I co-taught (along with Marco Mondelli) the Ph.D. class on Information Theory (for Data Science).
The class covered a variety of classical and more modern results with an information-theoretic flavor.
More precisely we covered: Information measures, compression, prediction, estimation,
large deviations (Sanov style), multi-armed bandits, exponential families,
exploration bias and generalisation error.
