I have been head Teaching Assistant for Advanced information, computation, communication II (AICC2)
for two years in a row. AICC2 is a large undergraduate class (~300 students) with meaningful challenges.
Its purpose is to expose first year bachelor students to applied probability theory,
information theory, coding theory and cryptography. I was in charge of leading the teaching assistants
team (2 PhD students, 10/12 bachelor/master students), coordinating the homework, exam, etc.
