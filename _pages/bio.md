My scientific agenda is summarised [here](/research), along with my list of publications. <br>
My teaching activity can be found [here](/teaching).<br>
My talks and service to academia can be found [here](/services).<br>

Until September 2024 I have been a Postdoctoral Resarcher at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) hosted by [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). 

I received my Doctoral Degree in 2022 from the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof. [Michael Gastpar](https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar/?lang=en). I received my MSc degree in 2017 from the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.di.unisa.it/en) of [Università degli Studi di Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/en/home) which has been selected, **for the second time in a row**, as a ['department of excellence'](https://www.di.unisa.it/unisa-rescue-page/dettaglio/id/1356/module/488/row/2532) by the Italian Ministry of Universities and Research.

I believe in [Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/) and in Scientific Divulgation. 

I am interested in every aspect of science but mostly in Mathematics, Information Theory, Theoretical Computer Science, Neuroscience, Psychology and Biology. 

Now, a bit about myself.

I believe in Slow Science: deep understanding and scientific production respect different timelines.
One can be much slower than the other, but they **both** must exist!

I have a vast range of interests, amongnst which lies my passion for scientific dissemination.
I was the host of a(n italian) [podcast](https://linktr.ee/ArmoniaPodcast) in which I tried to simplify and render accessible 
(but most importantly, applicable) the most recent findings in neuroscience, biology and psychology.
Part of my plan was also to spread awareness on the high-quality research that is happening in Italy in any field. 
My purpose was to reply to the following questions:
- what is Science?  
- How does it work? 
- Where are we at right now in most fields? 

Let us re-ignite the trust of humanity in Science!

I also believe in the importance of mental health and of taking care of oneself. 
Consequently, part of my efforts were directed towards demistifying psychotherapy and psychiatry. 
Awareness is always the first step.

I was amongst the organisers of the ''Think and Drink'' seminar series at ISTA. The purpose is 
to encourage interdisciplinarity and to spread awareness about the respective topics of research.
We continuously invite local scientist to provide a short but, most importantly, accessible talk
on a topic that matters to them (generally, their research topic). The talk is then followed by a light buffet 
with drinks to encourage socialisation.
Enabling communication between hard sciences and soft sciences, but also within the respective areas,
is a tough challenge but we believe it can be addressed! 
As somewhat of an interdiscplinarian myself I acknowledge the power and the potential of inter-field
communication. A concept beautifully expressed by [Prof. Ugo Vaccaro](http://intranet.di.unisa.it/~uv/)
in this [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7ritT7pA10&ab_channel=IlPodcastArmonia) (you can 
enable english subtitles there!).
