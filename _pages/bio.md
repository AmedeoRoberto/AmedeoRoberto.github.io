* Postdoctoral Researcher, Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), present

My scientific agenda is summarised [here](/pages/research.md). 
I believe in Slow Science: deep understanding and scientific production respect different timelines.
One is much slower than the other and before co-existing **both** must exist!

I have a vast range of interests, among which lies my passion for scientific dissemination.
I was the host of a(n italian) [podcast](https://linktr.ee/ArmoniaPodcast) in which I tried to simplify and render accessible 
(but most  importantly, applicable) the most recent findings in neuroscience, biology and psychology.
Part of my plan was also to spread awareness on the high-quality research that is happening in Italy
in literally any field. My purpose was replying to the following questions: what is Science? 
How does it work? Where are we at right now in most fields? 
Let us re-ignite the trust of humanity in Science!

I also believe in the importance of mental health and of taking care of oneself. 
Consequently, part of my efforts were directed towards demistifying psychotherapy and psychiatry. 
Awareness is always the first step.

I am amongst the organisers of the ''Think and Drink'' seminar series at ISTA. The purpose is 
to encourage interdisciplinarity and to spread awareness about the respective topics of research.
We continuously invite local scientist to provide a short (but most importantly) accessible talk
on a topic that matters to them (generally, their research topic), followed by a light buffet 
with drinks to encourage socialisation.
Enabling communication between hard sciences and soft sciences (but also within the respective areas)
is a tough challenge but we believe it can be addressed! 
As somewhat of an interdiscplinarian myself I acknowledge the power and the potential of inter-fields
communication. A concept beautifully expressed by [Prof. Ugo Vaccaro](http://intranet.di.unisa.it/~uv/)
in this [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7ritT7pA10&ab_channel=IlPodcastArmonia) (you can 
enable english subtitles there!).
