My research lies at the intersection of Information Theory, Probability Theory and Functional Analysis. 
To get to know my views on the (fundamental) connection among the fields you can check out my [thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/294547).
Applications of my results range from Learning Theory (see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8849834), 
[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9444402), 
[here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8989057), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06399), 
and [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9174117)), to Probability Theory 
(see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9517944)) and Estimation Theory (see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9517954)
and [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9834708)).

My current interests consist in a deeper exploration of the framework I set up during my PhD,
and I am grateful for being able to do so with [Marco Mondelli](http://www.marcomondelli.com).

The work I am most proud of is, at the moment, only available as a [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9834354) 
(Journal on its way). It encapsulates my views in which Information Measures simply are a bridge between spaces of measures
and spaces of functions and therein lies their power.
