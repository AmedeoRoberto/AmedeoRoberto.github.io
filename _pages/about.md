Until September 2024 I will be a Postdoctoral Resarcher at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) hosted by [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). 

I received my Doctoral Degree in 2022 from the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof. [Michael Gastpar](https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar/?lang=en).

I believe in [Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/) and in Scientific Divulgation. 

I am interested in every aspect of science but mostly in Mathematics, Information Theory, Theoretical Computer Science, Neuroscience, Psychology and Biology.
