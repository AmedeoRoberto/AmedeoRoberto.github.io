I am a Postdoctoral Resarcher at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) hosted by [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). I received my Doctoral Degree in 2022 from the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I had the pleasure of being adviced by Prof. [Michael Gastpar](https://people.epfl.ch/michael.gastpar/?lang=en). I received my MSc degree in 2017 from the Department of [Computer Science](https://www.di.unisa.it/en) of the [Università degli Studi di Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/en/home) which has been selected, **for the second time in a row**, as a ['department of excellence'](https://www.di.unisa.it/unisa-rescue-page/dettaglio/id/1356/module/488/row/2532) by the Italian Ministry of Universities and Research.

I believe in [Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/) and in Scientific Divulgation. 

I am interested in every aspect of science but mostly in Mathematics, Information Theory, Theoretical Computer Science, Neuroscience, Psychology and Biology.
